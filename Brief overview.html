It’s a voice assistant, not too different from the current alternatives, but with a few key features:</div><div><br/></div><div>- The motto is “A human assistant. Built for humans”. I focus on making it personal, intuitive, focused on the user, and like a real personal assistant.</div><div>- Assistants talk to each other (e.g. my assistant talks to my friends’ assistants)</div><div>- The assistant is connected to Freebase and Wolfram Alpha, so it can answer lots of general knowledge questions</div><div>- The assistant learns about the user: their preferences, friends, behaviour, etc. Then it can predict things. e.g.:</div><div>     - it learns that the user sends a “good night” message to someone every evening, the assistant will ask the user whether they want the assistant to send it instead (automatically); though I don’t think this’d be a common use case</div><div>     - it learns what pizza the user likes. When they ask the assistant “Order my favourite pizza” the assistant will show a card with the order (what type of pizza, how many etc.) and will ask “Send order of $10.99?”</div><div><br/></div><div>Right now I’m working alone. I have in place:</div><div>1) an Android app with on-boarding screens, speech recognition, text to speech. I’m working on authentication and server communication right now</div><div>2) an Akka server (actor based, highly scalable, Continuous Delivery is almost finished). Authentication logic is done; I have some basic text processing (NLP) and input processing in place too</div><div><br/></div><div>As I said, I’m working alone right now, but I need in my team:</div><div>- A marketer/entrepreneur/finance person/business person to set up a business plan, do market and consumer analysis, work on a pitch deck, help with raising funds etc. I don’t have enough experience with this stuff.</div><div>- 1 Psychology expert; although I’m not that sure we really need one, it might help</div><div>- A few Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence experts. I’m taking a Machine Learning course myself (almost finished), but I don’t have much practical experience. I really need innovative thinking to achieve what I have in mind.</div></body></html>
